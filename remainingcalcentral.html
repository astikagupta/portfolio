                    <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">Our team tackled the difficult task of how college students manage their personal
finances. With college financial information housed in so many different places, there isn’t
any single tool that helps students get a comprehensive view of their student finances.
Our team interviewed undergraduate and graduate students to understand the pain
points of the financial planning process. We heard that the current process is
time-consuming, often confusing, and emotionally straining.
From there, we went through the user-centered design process to test and experiment
with different ways to make the process better. Over the course of many prototypes, we
honed in on helping students plan for a single semester with common categories of
income and expenses to help them get started. Our approach focused on designing for the
most useful and helpful experience to help people feel empowered with their finances.</p>

                    <p align="justify"><em>User Interviews + Contextual Inquiry</em><br>
To approach the problem of student budgeting we interviewed current Berkeley students
and observed their current budgeting process. We began this process by outlining some
vital questions that we wanted to gain insight into:
● How do students budget, if they budget at all?
● What budget tools are currently popular with students?
● What do the students like or dislike about their current budget tool or process?
● How much financial jargon do students understand?
● To what degree do students budget, and on what timeframe?
● Do graduate and undergraduate students have different needs?
To get answers to these questions we targeted students from various backgrounds in
term of year, major, and degree level. We also interviewed international students to
understand whether there were any problems that might be unique to their situation.</p>

                    <h3><u>Prototypes</u></h3>
                    

                    <p align="justify"><em>Paper Prototypes</em><br>
The first time we set pen to paper was with the paper prototypes. Translating the vague
ideas in our heads to more concrete forms on paper was challenging. We wanted to
diverge on ideas and therefore ended up with many ideas on the table by different
members of the team. Early on we decided to develop various versions of the prototypes
by refining all the ideas that we brought in, testing each of them to understand what might
work and what didn't.<br><em>Lo-Fi Prototypes</em><br>
At this stage, our main aim was to create clickable and somewhat interactive prototypes
so that we could see what functionality users would be comfortable using. We wanted to
test out all the different features as well as different versions of some of the features.
Thus we created a handful of slightly different prototypes, which we found valuable.<br><em>Interactive Prototype</em><br>For the interactive prototype, our biggest priority was to get some kind of working data so
that users could actually experience what would happen when values in the tool changed.
We felt this was necessary for testing and getting accurate results of how people would
use the tool. Thus we were keenly aware of where we should spend our time and energy in
order to achieve that outcome. We outlined the tradeoffs we would have to make in order
to reach that point, knowing that we couldn’t spend time designing features that wouldn’t
be feasible to implement in the interactive prototype.</p>

                    <h3><u>Demonstration</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">Our final prototype incorporated nearly all the functionality of our design plan. We
focused on solving the main problems of our primary persona:
● Minimizing time spent on budgeting by loading university data (we simulated this
in the prototype, as it won’t be available until linked with university APIs)
● Providing common/suggested categories and items to guide new users
● Providing a visual graph and text to highlight when a user might run out of money</p>
                    <hr class="primary">

                    <h3><u>Future Plans</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">
While we are very happy with how far the tool has come over the semester, there is a lot
left to do to make this tool a success. Our testing confirmed that our tool can make the
process of budgeting much faster, but only a longer-term study could verify the feeling of
control that we want to give students. They need to use the tool with their own data, and
we’d like to test for that. Besides the other design considerations that have revealed
themselves, we will also need to fully integrate with the CalCentral APIs before launching.
Getting there will require additional discussion and implementation to solve backend data
and security needs. As the CalCentral dev team is fully booked until late 2016, that’s the
earliest this tool might see the light of day on CalCentral. However, many of us want to
continue working on this project to get it to that point, and the CalCentral UX team has
been very supportive. Expect to see something like this on CalCentral before we graduate
in 2017!</p>
