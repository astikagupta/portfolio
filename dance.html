                    <h3><u>My Role</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">Individually ideated and designed a software that would help a dancer choreograph his/her own piece of dance with the help of this tool based on the images/videos of postures/steps already stored in the database.</p>
                    <hr class="primary">
                    <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">As a trained Bharatnatyam and Kathak (Indian classical dance forms) dancer for the last 20 years, I have always encountered situations wherein the choreography of a particular theme-based dance piece took the most time only because there are a lot of postures and steps to choose from; so many that it’s almost impossible for me to remember all the relevant steps and postures that can go for a theme and hence I end up redoing the entire piece several times to come up with the final piece to my heart’s satisfaction. The final piece now of course has to be tested if it is in tandem with the selected music and few changes in the piece may not be a surprise. This indeed takes me days, some times weeks together even before the actual practice has started. I am sure this problem is faced by many dancers like me and may be not just for Indian classical dances but for any other established dance form with a rich collection of postures and steps. So what if I develop a software/website which provides a dancer to choreograph her dance with an opportunity to choose every step from a list populated with all the possible dance steps that there can be and make an informed decision.

This software would have different gif images/images/short videos of steps/postures, which the dancer can choose from and create a final dance piece containing sequentially the individual components she has chosen.

                    <p align="justify">I used the Balsamiq prototyping tool to create many different prototypes to design the software.</p>

                    <h3><u>Moving Forward</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">Going further I plan to code this software based on this design using Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, SQL, Python. This software can be scaled further to include other established dance forms.</p>
