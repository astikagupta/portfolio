                    <h3><u>My Role</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">I was the designer of a 6 member team consisting of UC Berkeley Scool of Information students; participated in the ideation and brainstorming process for coming up with the final project idea. I came up with the initial idea of tetraplegics using VR technology for the purpose of tutoring from the comforts of their homes. After brainstorming further, we as a team decided that online tutoring could be one of the job options for the tetraplegics along with the jobs of a receptionist, real time guide for a zoo/museum/exhibition, information desk person etc. </p>

                    <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">
                        The purpose of Happy2Help is to provide tetraplegics the confidence, independence and ability to contribute to family and community by having a meaningful job. Instead of aiming at catering to their recreational motves, we decided to look beyond and provide them with an ability to pursue a paid and satisfactory job that will remain with them for life.</p>
                    <hr class="primary">
                    
                    <h3><u>User Experience Research</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">After conducting user reaserch, we found that beinf able to move and walk are not the real meaning of well-being for tetraplegics and instead being independent, having self-esteem and having the satisfaction of being able to contribute monetarily to their families was the ultimate meaning of happiness for them. We came up with a primary persona of Alex Mitchell, a 48 year old tetraplegic looking for ways to become independent and self-sufficient.

                    <h3><u>Prototypes</u></h3>
                    

                    <p align="justify">We iterated through many use cases for the tetraplegics. The initial ideas that we thought about were helping the blind people in their everyday tasks with the tetraplegic as the guide or online tutoring with the tetraplegic being the tutor.  However, we decided that our product should have a broader functionality with these ideas being opne of the several job options a tetraplegic may have. So finally we deicded to provide them with an array of jobs that they can choose from to the best of their comfort and abilities keepong in mind tat their strongest assets are their eye sight and voice. Th eprocess involved coming up with different paper prototypes for the same.</p>

                    <h3><u>Demonstration</u></h3>
                    <p align="justify">Along with the proposal drawn and explained out on a huge piece of chart paper, we also produced a short video with a virtual reality augmentation. In the video, a tourist, Ellie, at a zoo looks at the animals with the help of a tetraplegic tour guide who is at his home. The tourist and her virtual guide have a much more informal and easy-paced session between them, something which would be difficult to achieve in the case of a physical tour guide.</p>

                   <!--  <h3><u>Moving Forward</u></h3>
                    <p>We look at the application being highly successful in providing multiple job opportunities to tetraplegic people and help them become a contributing member of society. We see this system easily being scaled with the help of existing technologies such as 3D cameras and existing VR technology. We can see organizations investing in this technology to become much more socially relevant and help in empowering employment opportunities for all. A future use case of the portal that we discussed above was allowing tetraplegic people to pair with blind people to help them out by providing them with guidance throughout certain activities and tasks that the blind people request for. The blind people are able to request for assistance in terms of voice guidance and extra pair of eyes. The tetraplegic people from their home and using their head mounted VR camera can help see what the 3D cameras attached to the blind people see. This would allow the tetraplegic to effectively help blind people in multiple tasks. We see a bright future for such technology and its use in helping tetraplegics overcome their disabilities and become more independent.</p>
